1. Abbreviations setup with hand-side-fix.nvim*hand-side-fix.nvim-abbreviations-setup-with-hand-side-fix.nvim*



This plugin simplifies the setup of abbreviations tailored to specific keyboard
layouts and keywords of programming languages. It addresses the common issue of
typos that arise when consecutive letters are pressed by different hands.

The plugin calculates keyword typos that occur from cross-handed typing and
configures Vimâ€™s native abbreviation system to correct them.

For example, in a language that supports the `const` keyword, typing `cosnt`
will correct the typo (in the case of a US keyboard). See the test data
<https://github.com/arminfro/hand-side-fix.nvim/tree/main/tests/hand-side-fix/expectations>
for all abbreviations.

You can also provide your own custom keywords to setup the correspondent
abbreviations.


INSTALLATION VIA LAZY.NVIM*hand-side-fix.nvim-abbreviations-setup-with-hand-side-fix.nvim-installation-via-lazy.nvim*

Requires neovim-nightly:

`opts = true` would also be sufficient for US keyboard. Here is an example with
some customization:

>lua
    {
      "arminfro/hand-side-fix.nvim",
      event = "BufEnter",
      opts = {
        layout = "us",
        excludes = { "fi" },
        custom_keywords = {
          {
            pattern = "*.md",
            keywords = {
              "the", "of", "and", "to", "in", "is", "was", "that", "for", "as", "with", "by",
              "on", "are", "from", "be", "or", "his", "were", "it", "an", "at", "not", "which",
              "have", "he", "had", "this", "has", "also", "their", "but", "one", "can", "its",
              "on", "the", "other", "been", "more", "they", "used", "first", "all", "two",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
